# fauxtary-v1

# Purpose
* Build a MIDI enabled controller to replicate the controls of a rotary mixer.
* Intended use is for DJ programs that accept Midi input (like Native Instruments Traktor).
* This will not replace a full fledged DJ controller, just provide rotary controls for controlling the mixes.

# Implementation
* Powered by Arduino in USB-MIDI mode.
